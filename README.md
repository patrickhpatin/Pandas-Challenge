The following folder structure is expected for my script and Readme file to work properly.  Nothing was changed from the homework folder structure except that I added 5 images to the &quot;/Images&quot; directory for the Readme file.  The folder structure should be:

<ul>HeroesofPymoli
  <li>/Images<ul>
    <li>AvgPurchValByGender.png</li>
    <li>PercPlayersByAgeRange.png</li>

<b>Pandas Homework Data Analysis - Heroes of Pymoli</b>
<br><br>
<b>Players by Gender<b>

It's not a mystery that most video game players are male.  So, it came as no surprise that there were more males for the game Heroes of Pymoli.  The following chart illustrates the enormous desparity between the genders of the players.

<br><br><br>
<b>Player Purchase Totals by Gender<b>

Interestingly though, it was the &quot;Other&quot; players who had the higher average purchase amount.  And, if you count the &quot;Other&quot; players as anomolies then Females have the higher average purchase amount, not males as I expected.

However, despite having the higher average purchase amount, males still generate the vast majority of the revenue.  And even if you combines the &quot;Other&quot; and Female Gender categories, male total purchases still total more - almost 5 times more!

<b>Percentage of Players by Age Range<b>

Diving deeper into our analysis, we find that most players are not only male but also college aged, between the ages of 20 and 24.

So, it comes as no surprise that our college aged players (mostly males) make up the majority of the total purchases.
